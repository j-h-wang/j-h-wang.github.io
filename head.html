									<h2>Dr. WANG, Jinghua</h2>
									<p>Prior to joining The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Dr. Jinghua Wang has worked as a research fellow on his visit to the Coastal Group lead by Prof. Philip L.-F. Liu in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore. He was also working as the associate professor in the Department of Ocean Engineering at Ocean University of China. He received his PhD in Hydraulic Engineering under supervision of Prof. Q.W. Ma at City, University of London in 2015, and BEng in Harbour, Waterway and Coastal Engineering at Ocean University of China in 2016. His research focuses on developing new insights for coastal and offshore disasters through numerical modelling of oceanic hazards such as storm surge, tsunamis, and rogue(freak) waves. He has been involved in many government funded projects in UK and Singapore associated with risk assessments on coastal and offshore disasters. 

									<p>He has made several original contributions to this field that can be summarized into three categories: i) He has developed a powerful numerical tool called Enhanced Spectral Boundary Integral (ESBI) method for modelling wave-wind-current interactions in realistic random seas in a phase-resolved manner; ii) He has participated in the development of the hybrid CFD package qaleFOAM for modelling interactions between waves, wind and floating renewable energy devices; iii) He has developed a numerical modelling approach for risk assessment of the compound tsunamis and storm surge impacts on Macau and Hong Kong. His contribution in this field is widely recognized (see publication page). 

									<p>He serves as a member of the editor board and a reviewer for many peer-reviewed journals. He is also a member of the ISOPE (International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers) International Hydrodynamics Committee. </p>
